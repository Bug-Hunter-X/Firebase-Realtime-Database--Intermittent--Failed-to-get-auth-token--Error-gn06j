This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in the Firebase Realtime Database where the client intermittently throws a 'Failed to get auth token' error, even with proper authentication. The bug is difficult to reproduce consistently. The solution involves implementing more robust error handling and potential retry mechanisms to deal with transient network issues or Firebase service disruptions.  The provided code illustrates the problem and a potential solution using exponential backoff for retries.
